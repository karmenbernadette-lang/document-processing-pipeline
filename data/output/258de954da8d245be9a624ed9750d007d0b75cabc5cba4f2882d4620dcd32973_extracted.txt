Project Definition 
This project implements Variation C: Scientific/Business Discovery Assistant, specifically 
designed for the property and casualty (P&C) insurance industry. The system serves as an 
actuarial intelligence platform that enables discovery of reserve trends, emerging risks, and 
competitive insights from publicly available insurance carrier filings and external risk data 
sources. 
Data Sources  
Primary 
The main data sources consist of SEC 10-K (annual) and 10-Q (quarterly) filings from the top 15 
property and casualty insurers from 2020 to 2024. These documents are sourced directly from 
the SEC EDGAR API, which provides free, public access to all corporate filings. 
From these top 15 companies, there would be approximately 60-75 documents per year across 
five years, totaling 300-375 filings. This represents comprehensive coverage of major market 
participants, including leading national carriers, regional specialists, and mutual insurers. 
Secondary 
While external data sources such as catastrophe databases and economic indicators were 
considered, format and accessibility constraints make their incorporation challenging. Thus, this 
initial implementation focuses exclusively on SEC filings to maintain a purely document-centric 
approach and ensure feasibility within project constraints. 
Time Span Rationale 
The 2020–2024 period was specifically selected because it captures several significant critical 
events that impact actuarial analysis, some of  which include the COVID-19 pandemic's impact 
on claims patterns and business interruption coverage, the emergence of severe social inflation 
in liability lines, unprecedented catastrophic loss events including the 2021 Winter Storm Uri

and 2023 Maui wildfires, and the dramatic shift from a prolonged low interest rate environment 
to rapid rate increases beginning in 2022. This timeframe provides sufficient historical depth for 
pattern recognition while maintaining relevance to current market conditions. 
Appropriateness for Chosen Variation 
●​ Standardized Structure: 10-K and 10-Q filings follow consistent formats mandated by 
SEC regulations, including standardized reserve disclosures (Schedule P), Management 
Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) sections, and financial statements. This consistency 
enables reliable pattern detection and cross-carrier comparison. 
●​ Dual Data Types: Filings contain both highly structured data (XBRL-tagged financial 
statements) and unstructured narrative content (MD&A sections explaining 
management's interpretation of results, risk factors, and forward-looking statements). 
This combination supports both quantitative analysis and qualitative interpretation. 
●​ Temporal Basis: Quarterly and annual filing cadence creates a natural time-series 
structure, enabling the system to track how reserve positions evolve, identify emerging 
trends before they fully materialize, and analyze the lag between initial reserve estimates 
and ultimate claim settlements. 
●​ Sufficient Volume for Pattern Detection: With 15 carriers reporting quarterly over five 
years, the corpus provides enough data points to identify meaningful patterns while 
remaining manageable for comprehensive analysis. 
Constraints and Feasibility 
●​ Access: All SEC filings are publicly available through the EDGAR API at no cost, with no 
authentication required. The API supports bulk downloads and provides both HTML and 
XBRL formats, and with the choice to not include the secondary sources, licensing 
barriers and access restrictions are eliminated. 
●​ Preprocessing Requirements: XBRL data can be parsed using standard libraries (such 
as python-xbrl) to extract structured financial metrics. Narrative sections can be handled 
through established NLP preprocessing using libraries such as BeautifulSoup or SpaCy. 
Schedule P data may require specialized parsing logic to handle its tabular format.

●​ No Licensing Issues: As stated previously, all SEC filings are in the public domain with 
no copyright or licensing restrictions. 
User Persona and Use Cases 
Role and Professional Context 
Sarah Chen is a Senior Reserving Actuary with 5–7 years of experience working at a mid-sized 
property and casualty insurance company. She is responsible for conducting quarterly reserve 
reviews across multiple lines of business, including commercial auto, general liability, workers' 
compensation, and homeowners insurance. Sarah reports directly to the Chief Actuary and 
regularly presents her findings to the CFO and board of directors. She collaborates closely with 
claims, underwriting, and finance departments. 
Primary Goals 
●​ Industry Awareness: Continuously monitor industry reserve trends and emerging risks 
that could impact her company's reserve adequacy 
●​ Competitive Benchmarking: Compare her company's reserve positions and 
methodologies against their peers to identify potential gaps or opportunities 
●​ Early Warning Detection: Identify signals of potential reserve inadequacy before they 
manifest in financial statements, allowing proactive adjustments 
●​ Executive Communication: Support quarterly reporting with peer analysis and industry 
context that strengthens her reserve recommendations 
●​ Defensible Recommendations: Defend reserve selections to senior management with 
data-driven evidence from across the industry 
Decision Environment and Constraints 
Sarah deals with significant time pressure during quarterly reserve review cycles that demands 
rapid yet in depth analysis. She must synthesize information from 15+ carrier filings efficiently, 
completing peer reviews of reserve studies within 2–3 weeks while maintaining her regular

reserving responsibilities. Her analysis must balance technical actuarial understanding with 
clear communication, as board members need to understand both the quantitative and 
qualitative context of reserve recommendations. Additionally, Sarah faces increased pressure to 
identify risks proactively. Stakeholders expect her to spot emerging trends before they fully 
impact financial results, requiring constant pattern recognition across the industry. 
Pain Points  
●​ Time-Consuming Manual Research: Currently, reviewing dozens of 10-K and 10-Q 
filings manually consumes several weeks of Sarah's quarterly cycle. She must read 
through lengthy documents, extract relevant sections, compile notes, and synthesize 
findings which leaves little time for strategic thinking. 
●​ Information Overload: The volume of emerging risks—from climate change impacts to 
evolving liability exposures to shifting economic conditions is difficult for Sarah to track. 
She relies on industry conferences and trade publications, but this reactive approach 
often means learning about trends after they've already had decent impact. 
●​ Competitive Intelligence Gaps: Sarah lacks insight into how peer carriers are 
responding to similar risks in real time. By the time annual reports are published and 
analyzed, competitive advantages or best practices may have already shifted. 
●​ Reactive Rather Than Proactive Posture: Without systematic monitoring tools, Sarah 
often learns about significant industry trends after they've fully emerged, limiting her 
ability to position her company advantageously or adjust reserves before deficiencies 
develop.
